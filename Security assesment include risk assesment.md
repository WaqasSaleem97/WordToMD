Security assesment include risk assesment , threat assesment and
vulnerability scan

TCP Syn scan uses first two steps of tcp handshake

TCP ACK scan sends an ACK packet, simulating a packet from the middle of
an already established connection.

data protection is ensured via smooth backup operation of org.

if cost is not matter than best option is use of multiple equipment for
any process.

Authenticated scans can read configuration information from the target
system and reduce the instances of false positive and false negative
reports.

privelleged accounts are first to be auditted for access review

. ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain are tools used to conduct threat
intelligence.openVAS is vulnerability scan tool

mutual indemnification is a contractual obligation that each party will
compensate in each loss or profit.03125556112

synthetic transactions and test coverage analysis to be studied

attacks of databases are done using 443 and 80 ports not 1521 or 1433
port

SOC1 : Financial reports and control effect on finance

SOC2 Type 1: security controls implementation

SOC2 Type 2 : effectiveness of controls

SOC3 :SOC 3 engagements assess the organization's controls that affect
the security and privacy of information stored in a system. The results
of a SOC 3 audit are intended for **public disclosure**

Branch coverage evaluates whether every if statement has been executed
under all if and else conditions. Condition coverage tests whether every
logical test in the code has been executed

Synthetic transaction in inputs entered in webpages to see functional
performances.Scripts containing routine activity with known results and
then compares the actual results of executing the script with expected
outcomes.

The management review and approval process ensures that each account was
appropriately authorized and remains necessary to meet business needs.

Review a random sample of 20% of accounts if 100% review is not
possible.

independent auditors should be engaged for audit.

Remember that **detective, recovery, and corrective controls** are
enforced after an incident is present. However, **deterrent, directive,
preventive, and compensating controls** are applicable before an
incident takes place.

**Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)** provides a naming system for
system configuration issues during vulnerabilityu analysis. Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) provides a naming system for
describing security vulnerabilities. Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
provides a naming system for operating systems, applications, and
devices

**10.0.0.0/8** will scan any IP address beginning with 10.

**Vulnerability scanners** can check systems to ensure they are
up-to-date with current patches

sqlmap identifies database vulnerabilities.

NIST **53a** is assesment of controls whiel **53** is description of
control

on premises cloud infra is owned by company and it can also lease its
services of hardware to other recipients.

**Fagan inspection** model uses the six formal steps of planning,
overview, preparation, inspection, rework, and follow-up to conduct a
formal code review process.
